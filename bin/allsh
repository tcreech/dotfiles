# Script to work with shell signal trapping to run shell commands in
# all shells. For example using zsh, set the following in ~/.zshrc:
#
# TRAPUSR2() {
#   [ -f ~/.sh-sourceall ] && . ~/.sh-sourceall
# }
#
# For more information, see:
#
# http://sial.org/howto/shell/allsh/
#
# Warning! This script has various potential security problems,
# especially where multiple users are involved with a shared account
# (root), or where write access to the ~/.sh-sourceall file is possible
# by untrusted users, e.g. via untrusted code injection into the file
# in question, especially if ~/.sh-sourceall is on an insecure network
# file system.

# public domain.

# routine to signal a process matching an expression with a
# specified signal.
#
# another option might be to have shells write their pids to somewhere
# like ~/.zsh/shellpids/$$, then just run through that file list, though
# cleanup of the files could be problematic

# KLUGE just clobber a known file, which will cause problems if multiple
# 'allsh' are run or if multiple users are involve somehow.
